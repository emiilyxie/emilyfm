    <div class="activity-header">Dentist Shadowing</div>
    <div class="opening-blurb">Over the summer from sophomore to junior year, I received an
      opportunity to shadow at Dr. Wang’s office. Every week I visited the office, each time
      observing and learning the life of a dentist specialized in implantology. Along with
      Dr. Wang, Annie, the assistant, and Terry, the receptionist, worked at the office,
      forming the amazing group of three that led me through the job of a dentist.</div>

      <div class="text-head">Implantology</div>
      <div class="text-body">
        I always thought Dr. Wang was a general dentist -- after all, she worked as a dentist
        for my family since long ago. I was surprised to find out that she actually specializes
        in implantology. Throughout the summer, I got a taste of all the steps of implantology.<br><br>
        In a condensed nutshell, because I don’t want this article to end up super technical and a hassle
        to read, I’ll just list the steps of implantology. Here's what I saw this summer: <br><br>
        <ol>
          <li>The consultation: it not only requires looking at the patient’s situation, but  this step also needs
            an analysis of the patient's personality in order to present the argument in the best manner. </li>
          <li>The big surgery: In this surgery, which I watched on my first day after only 30 minutes in the office, Dr.
            Wang injects the anaesthesia with a huge needle, extracts the necessary teeth, cuts open
            the gum to expose the bone, drills holes in the bone for the implant, and sews everything
            back up. Since it’s a big surgery, I always dressed up in full surgeon gear: hairnet, apron,
            mask.</li>
          <li>The next appointment is a suture removal, taking out the mesh and string from the last
            surgery. Now, the worst is over for the patient. After a couple of months the patient returns,
            healed. Dr. Wang uses a cookie-cutter like tool to re-expose the drilled portions and takes
            a couple of molds using alginate. She taught me that there are different thicknesses (colors)
            of alginate used for different purposes: thicker alginate provides an overall structure for
            the mold while thinner alginate solutions produce a more detailed mold. When both are used
            together, the resulting mold accurately recreates a plaster version of the patient’s mouth. </li>
          <li>Building the implant: Dr. Wang ships the plaster model to company, which creates a personalized abutment for the
            implant, or the part that fits into the drilled hole in the bone and connects to the final
            crown. Another company creates the crown. Fun fact: there’s a whole shade range for teeth
            that I saw, which was pretty interesting. </li>
          <li>The last step of the several month long treatment
            ends with all the components combining together to create a lifelong, natural looking tooth
            for the “patient patient” (aha).</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="text-head">Reflection</div>
      <div class="text-body">
        I really enjoyed this experience. Here’s what I learned about dentistry.<br><br>
        The job of a dentist is intellectually stimulating. Along with implantology, I learned much more
        technical information that I’ll list but not explain in-depth: sterilization, different tools, x-ray
        / radiology, tooth extraction, etc. During surgeries, improvisation can solve almost any roadblock,
        but the thinking needs to be quick and accurate.<br><br>
        On the other hand, dentistry is a social job. Dr. Wang told me that the top priority of being a dentist
        is to make sure your patient is happy. This means that communication is key. Often during appointments,
        Dr. Wang engages in deep conversations, relieving the stress of patients. I’ve met many interesting patients:
        one person lived as a firefighter, fisherman, and cowboy; another person is an actor who appeared in 13
        Reasons Why; many are bilingual (and speak Chinese, so I talked with them in Chinese!).<br><br>
        Overall, I take from this summer of shadowing a possible career choice. Although the school part may be
        costly and tiring, the job of dentistry itself seems worth it. I will definitely continue looking at other
        fields to venture into, but dentistry sits toward the top of my list.
